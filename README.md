# sstv-experiment
A couple of Batch scripts for encoding a video's frames into [SSTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television), and then decoding it back to a video.

It takes a **very long** time though. You need to spend almost 9 hours to decode a minute-long 15 FPS footage!

## Setup
You will need to install Python 3.7+ and RX-SSTV in order to use the scripts.

1. Go to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version of Python.
    - Remember to enable the `Add to PATH` checkbox before clicking `Install Now` at the first installation screen.
    - If you already have Python installed, you can skip this step.
2. Go to [the RX-SSTV website](https://www.qsl.net/on6mu/rxsstv.htm) and download RX-SSTV.
3. Run `python3 -m pip install PySSTV` to install the dependency used for encoding SSTV.
4. Done! You can move to the "Usage" section now!

## Usage
*will write that down later on, maybe :^) for now you can look at the scripts to get a hang of it*

As with all my projects, contributions are highly appreciated!
